# Planewave scattering by Microflown PU Probe 

An incident plane wave is scattered by the Microflown PU Probe which 
may contain a steel mesh (treated as acoustically equivalent to 
micro-perforated panels, or MPP) and a porous windscreens.

Dah-You-Maa's model is used for the MPP and JCAL model for the porous layer.
Optimal PML model is used to replicate the non-reflecting boundaries. 
The ensemble is coupled with interface conditions and solved using the 
displacement formulation of the Helmholtz-like equations using the FEM method.

NOTE: The parameters for these models needs to obtained from data!
