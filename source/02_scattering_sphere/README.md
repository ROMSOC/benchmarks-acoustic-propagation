# Planewave scattering by sphere

This directory contains scripts to develop and analyze FEM method to solve for scattering 
by a sphere of an incident plane/radial wave. Since the exact solutions can be obtained 
for this scenario it is ideal to perform analysis of the FEM method and also validate the solver.
