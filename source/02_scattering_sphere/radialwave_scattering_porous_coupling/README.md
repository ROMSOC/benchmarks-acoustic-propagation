# Radial wave scattering by a rigid sphere with a spherical porous layer

A radial wave is incident on a rigid sphere which is surrounded by a spherical porous layer. The script `scattering_sphere_porous.py` computes
the resulting field using the Johnson-Champoux-Allard-Lafarge (JCAL) Model for a few typical parameter values, and compares them against the 
exact solution. The exact solution requires an inverse method to compute radial wave amplitudes within the subdomains.
